## Acrylic app repository

This is the repository of apps for Acrylic, including both the core apps and 3rd party apps.

**A few things:**
* Each app should go into its own folder here.
* Want to add/update an app? Make a [pull request](https://github.com/acrylic-os/apps/pulls).
* If your app is open source, you should have a separate repo for it, then mirror the code to this repo when there's a new release.
