## Acrylic extensions repository

This is the repository of extensions (3rd-party apps, plugins, and themes) for Acrylic.

**A few things:**
* Each extension should go into its own folder here.
* Want to add/update an extension? Make a [pull request](https://github.com/acrylic-os/extensions/pulls).
* If your app is open source or source-available, you should have a separate repo for it, then mirror the code to this repo when there's a new release.
